# Code-Refactor

## Description

This code has been refactored to meet a certain set of standards without changing the functionality of everything. The purpose is to be able to practice defining semantic elements and identify the use of everything in the code. This is more difficult than you'd expect, many elements are not as easily discernable and sometimes can be mistaken for other elements or made to look different.

## User Story

```md

AS A studen
I WANT to better understand the functionality of the code I am given
SO THAT I can better understand how everything works
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md

GIVEN a front end webpage
WHEN I view the code
THEN I see clear definition of the purpose of each part
WHEN I look at the HTML
THEN I can easily identify the placement of elements
WHEN I look at the CSS attributes
THEN I can tell which belongs to which element
```
